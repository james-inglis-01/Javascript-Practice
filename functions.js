/*
A function is a block of code designed to perform a task.

Functions are like recipes. They take data or variables, perform a set of tasks on them, and then return the result. The beauty of functions is that they allow us to write a chunk of code once, then we can reuse it over and over without writing the same code over and over.

Take a look at this code:
*/

var calculatorOn = false;

function pressPowerButton() {
  if (calculatorOn) {
    console.log('Calculator turning off.');
    calculatorOn = false;
  } else {
    console.log('Calculator turning on.');
    calculatorOn = true;
  }
}

pressPowerButton();
// Output: Calculator turning on.

pressPowerButton();
// Output: Calculator turning off.

/*
This code turns the calculator on if it is currently off, and turns it off if the calculator is currently on.

See if you can figure out how this code works. In the next exercise, we'll walk through it line by line.
*/



var calculatorOn = false;

function pressPowerButton() {
  if (calculatorOn) {
    console.log('Calculator turning off.');
    calculatorOn = false;
  } else {
    console.log('Calculator turning on.');
    calculatorOn = true;
  }
}

pressPowerButton();
// Output: Calculator turning on.

pressPowerButton();
// Output: Calculator turning off.

/*
On line 1, we have a variable named calculatorOn set to false. Our program starts with the calculator in the off position.
On line 3, there's a function named pressPowerButton. Functions follow this syntax:

• They begin with the JavaScript keyword function.

• After function comes the name of the function. pressPowerButton is the name of the function. Notice there are no spaces in the name and each new word is capitalized. This is a convention in the JavaScript community called camelCase.

• After the function's name, comes parentheses (). We'll learn about these in the next exercise.

• Finally, the function has a block of code it executes between the curly braces {}.
Inside the function is an if/else statement.
On the last few lines, we make the function run by writing pressPowerButton(). This term for this is calling the function. We call it with pressPowerButton(), and it runs all the code in the block of the function.
We executed the code in the block of the function twice without having to write it twice. Functions can make code reusable!

/*
The calculator program should be able to perform a math operation on a number. We should be able to give a calculator a number, have it perform a task on it like multiplication, then print a result.

Currently, we have no way to give a function a number. To do this, we can use parameters. Parameters are variables that we can set when we call the function. For example:
*/

function multiplyByThirteen(inputNumber) {
  console.log(inputNumber * 13);
}

multiplyByThirteen(9);
// Output: 117

/*
We added inputNumber within the parentheses of the multiplyByThirteen function. inputNumber is a parameter.
Inside the multiplyByThirteen function, we use console.log to print the inputNumber by 13.
When we call the multiplyByThirteen function on the last lines, we set the inputNumber parameter. For instance, multiplyByThirteen(9) calls the multiplyByThirteen function, and sets inputNumber as 9. Then, inside the block of the multiplyByThirteen function, 9 is multiplied by 13, resulting in 117 printing to the console.
Note on terminology: inputNumber is a parameter, but when we call multiplyByThirteen(9), the 9 is called an argument. Therefore, arguments are provided when you call a function, and parameters receive arguments as their value. So, inputNumber is a parameter and its value is the argument 9, since we wrote multiplyByThirteen(9).
Parameters let us write logic inside functions that can be modified based on when we call the function, which will help make our functions more flexible.
